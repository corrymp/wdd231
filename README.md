This repo contains *CorryMP*'s classwork for wdd231: **Web Frontend Development I**.
## Note:
You are welcome to view my work.
If, however, you are currently taking wdd231, copy/pasting from this repo would most likely be plagiarism.
*That would* ***be an act of academic dishonesty*** *and* ***violate the Honor Code.***
If I had a nickle for every time I noticed it happen to me, I'd have **two** nickels - which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened **twice**.
